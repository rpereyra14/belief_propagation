# belief_propagation

First attempt at a belief propagation algorithm for adding color to an input image.
This implementation does not work as intended (it fails to add color and just outputs a black and white image) but I feel like it still adds value to GitHub. The bug is likely in the message passing algorithm.
This task was completed as part of a UNC's COMP 590 Machine Learning, Spring 2013.
